                <h2 class="menu-item-title" id="1st">Chicken</h2>
                <p> Tomato butter works wonders on chicken. Not only does it keep the bird moist, but the healthy dose of tomato paste brings a slightly sweet, umami acidity, which chicken could often use. Plus, there are no better veggies than ones that have been roasted underneath a chicken, collecting all of that flavor-packed schmaltz. This is a great way to add some excitement to a classic roast chicken.

                <p> Red wine braised beef with tomatoes and herbs is a showstopper. Rich and hearty, save it for a lazy winter Sunday dinner with friends and family. It goes perfectly with roasted vegetables or over polenta. And don‚Äôt forget the vino!

                <p> Sushi is a Japanese dish that features medium-grained rice cooked in vinegar, served with raw or cooked seafood and a variety of toppings or fillings. Contrary to popular belief, rice is the main component of sushi, not raw fish. You are probably familiar with the sight of rolled sushi sliced into perfect bite-sized pieces, but not all sushi is rolled.
